What's Next
===========


Create a game from scratch, deliberately making syntax errors in the code.
    Fix any bugs and improve the UI along the way. 

Catch all ScriptExceptions
    Report them to ScriptErrorLog, which will also write to stderr (not as a stack trace)
    An icon on the popup Layer shows when a new error has occurred. Click to open the log viewer.
        "Clear" button will remove the icon from the popup layer. 
How about a Scripts tab
    List all scripts double click to edit.
    Show errors / Clear errors

Check that a broken script doesn't cause problems :
    Costume Properties
    Behaviour in editor
    Behaviour in designer
    SceneBehaviour in editor
    SceneBehaviour in designer
    Game

Bugs
====

One of the animation profiles shows that the NumericAnimation isn't quite right.

On Remove, there is no check that the resource isn't being used by something else.
    Easy pose, animation, sound..., but tricky for costume, as they could be used in any scene

Renaming a costume will cause scenes that use it to fail.

Costumes are updated even when cancel is pressed (need to COPY the costume?)
    CostumesEditor needs to copy the costume so that cancel works.

Later
=====

A Gallery
    Import poses, costumes, fonts, animations etc from a set of "games" in the gallery, or from any
    other game's resources.

Is the special Map needed which allows scripted Costume properties to be retrieved from BeanHelper
    Now we have ScriptedObject, isn't it better to have it done that way?
    Would need a "set" version of the special code too.

Scripted Behaviours can't detect MouseEvents.
    The whole Layer as a MouseListener needs looking at.

"include" javascript function, which includes another script file.

Copy the arm binary
    Test Itchy on Pi

Text Costumes.
    Buttons can have sounds and animations

Compile on raspPi?


Get Thrust to run via "launch" without the resource symlinks to itchy.
    Need thrusts jar file to be in a lib directory within its resources, and for the jar to be loaded
    after java has started.

Bucket to be more transparent
Water looks naff

The stars on Drunk Invaders backgrounds should have more variation (alpha and slight colour - maybe size too).

Component : Override all rules. Currently only Font can be overridden.  
    Allow to be reset to default (i.e. be restyled). 

Create a game which uses the GUI        
    The Rules object needs to be on Game, its probably on Itchy right now.

Try it on a RaspPi
    Need to compile Jame for the ARM processor!

The Behaviours should have the tags, because its them that have the Interface.
Also, I could change the behaviour, and the tags would magically vanish (without the "removeAll"!
Don't use tags for "active".

Container.render should get the NinePatches to render directly onto the gc, not via a temp surface.
RenderableInterface is rubbish. NinePatches should be told where and how large to draw themselves
   (assuming that they can render onto a existing surface rather than needing a new surface).

Replace crufty render and render2 methods with the concept of a Graphics Context.
To scroll, a sub-layer, push the context, alter its mapping, call the childrens render,
then pop the context.

Appearance optimised so that it doesn't need to re-render the appearance to get the worldRectangle
    Maybe calculate the maximum rectangle for the Pose for any rotation
    When asked for its worldRect, if cached, returned that, other wise if direction == 0, return pose.rectangle * scale, otherwise return maximum rect * scale
