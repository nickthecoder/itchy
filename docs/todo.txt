===========

Rain to use NumberValue instead of HishScore and Score.

Copy the arm binary
    Test Itchy on Pi

When getting a property value from a script, if it doesn't return a valid value, report in stderr, and
    return a reasonable default. "", 0, 0.0, black.

CostumeProperties
    Use auto update components, so we don't have the fragile "for" loop in onOk.
    CostumesEditor needs to copy the costume so that cancel works.

"include" javascript function, which includes another script file.

Check that Add Scene doesn't rename.

Check that a broken script doesn't cause problems :
    Costume Properties
    Behaviour in editor
    Behaviour in designer
    SceneBehaviour in editor
    SceneBehaviour in designer
    Game


Scripted Behaviours can't detect MouseEvents.
    The whole Layer as a MouseListener needs looking at.

Bugs
====

Can't edit a Rain scene when starting the editor directly
    The GameBehaviour isn't initialised, but it is trying to read the properties???

One of the animation profiles shows that the NumericAnimation isn't quite right.

When a window has no focusable components, then it recurses till the stack explodes.

Popup windows dont center themselves when window grows. Should they?

On Remove, there is no check that the resource isn't being used by something else.
    Easy pose, animation, sound..., but tricky for costume, as they could be used in any scene
    
Renaming a costume will cause scenes that use it to fail.

Costumes are updated even when cancel is pressed (need to COPY the costume?)

Later
=====

Text Costumes.
    Buttons can have sounds and animations

Compile on raspPi?


Get Thrust to run via "launch" without the resource symlinks to itchy.
    Need thrusts jar file to be in a lib directory within its resources, and for the jar to be loaded
    after java has started.

Bucket to be more transparent
Water looks naff

The stars on Drunk Invaders backgrounds should have more variation (alpha and slight colour - maybe size too).

Component : Override all rules. Currently only Font can be overridden.  
    Allow to be reset to default (i.e. be restyled). 

Icons on each editor tab and also on the CostumeEditor for each event type (String,Pose,Sound etc).

Create a GenericGame, which can load arbitrary resources (for a simple start to a game)
    Started (called Launcher).

Create a game which uses the GUI        
    The Rules object needs to be on Game, its probably on Itchy right now.

Try it on a RaspPi
    Need to compile Jame for the ARM processor!

The Behaviours should have the tags, because its them that have the Interface.
Also, I could change the behaviour, and the tags would magically vanish (without the "removeAll"!
Don't use tags for "active".

Container.render should get the NinePatches to render directly onto the gc, not via a temp surface.
RenderableInterface is rubbish. NinePatches should be told where and how large to draw themselves
   (assuming that they can render onto a existing surface rather than needing a new surface).


Replace crufty render and render2 methods with the concept of a Graphics Context.
To scroll, a sub-layer, push the context, alter its mapping, call the childrens render,
then pop the context.

Appearance optimised so that it doesn't need to re-render the appearance to get the worldRectangle
    Maybe calculate the maximum rectangle for the Pose for any rotation
    When asked for its worldRect, if cached, returned that, other wise if direction == 0, return pose.rectangle * scale, otherwise return maximum rect * scale
