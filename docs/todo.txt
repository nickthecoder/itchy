Current Tasks
=============

Duplicate scene

Implement change Layout in scene designer.
    Rename a Layer needs to update all scenes (just like renaming a costume, but the owner needs to be the Layout).



Make some gates need balloons 2, rocks 2, instead of 3, 3?
    Or make a new balloons3?

Look over all TODOs


Destroy-Debris
    Do the offsets for all rocks (most are done).
    Adjust the speed and rotation for both ships to make good game play.
 

BUGS
