Current Tasks
=============

Remove scene.backgroundColor

Debris : Life icons don't appear

Can't access the "hud" layer from ship's onBirth
    Because the hud is loaded in the sceneDirectors onActivate, and onBirth is called before that.

SceneDesigner
    Views should NOT be the one from Layout, but a scrollable one, which covers the whole screen.
        Bounds are the whole screen, and offsets are based on the layer's position (and any scroll amount by the editor).

    Layer to have a getDesignView method.

SceneDesigner: one dotted box for the screen's  bounds, and another for the current view's if they are different.

SceneDesigner
    When scrolling, then StageViews should be scrolled, but non-stage view should just be moved
        e.g. a RGBAView should only cover the inside of the dotted rectangle.
    Therefore editor needs to add another black RGBAView behind all the others.


SceneDirector has a Layout, which can be used to find stages. Don't use Itchy's view tree.

SceneDesigner's Layers tab: Add a "..." button if the layer or the stage have properties.

Remove background colour from SceneResource - Implement this as a layer.

When loading/merging layouts, need to clone the layers, including the view, stage and the view's and stage's properties.

How should StageConstraint be handled?
    AbastractStage has stageConstaint as a property, but I can't save arbitrary classes (yet?).
    Also, I can't set the attributes of the stage complaint, nor choose the StageContraint implementation from the GUI.
    
    Could subclass ZOrderStage (or whatever), and "hard code" the stage constraint there.
        Nasty
        
    Give Layer a stageConstraint ClassName, and add this to the Layout GUI and save/load. 
        Better. Do this!
    

SceneDesigner onPaste, and maybe other places uses addTop, but now that costumes have default ZOrders, it makes more sensse
    to use add, and let them have the same ZOrder.


Renaming a Layer/Layout will need to alter all scenes???
    Or SceneDesigner can handle missing Layout/Layers, and still muddle through.

Game.loadScene, calls Role.sceneCreated only for the "main" load, not for additional scenes, such as
    glass view for highscores, lives etc.

SceneDesigner : Show the current layer in the toolbar as a button. Click to switch.

BUGS
====

Appearance.fixPose doesn't do the right thing with direction.
	Setting dir to 0 works, but ideally both appearance and the new pose should have the old appearance's direction,
	and yet the pose won't need rotating.

Can delete Poses which are used in a Framed animation
    Ditto for a Sprite.

Name not saved when editing an Input.


Trivial Bugs
============

Ensure Scrollbars of Scroll do not obscure the contents.

New Features
============

Reset Z-order of all actors based on their costume's z-order.

Design Stages/Views graphically - Aim for no code in Director.
Better editing for views which are not the whole screen.
    The-Mings has a GUI at the bottom, and a scrollable area above.
        The editor should reflect this.
    Create a "Layout" tab, where the layouts are edited.
        The GUI scene uses a short, non-scrolling Stage/View Layout. Called "GUI"
        The playing scenes use the layout with scrolling view(s). Called "Arena"
    The "Play" SceneDirector loads the scene as normal, and ALSO loads the GUI scene.
        This will create both sets of Stages/Views.

    The GUI and .itchy file format could only allow a LIST of view/stages, not a TREE.
    Also, make the relationship 1:1 between Stage and View to keep it simple.

    How can views be customised on a per scene basis?
        E.g. A layout has a RGBBackground or a TiledBackground. How is the colour / tile info picked?

    Is a layout made up of Stages or of Views?
        RGBBackground is a View, not a stage
        But most of the time we care about the type of stage. e.g. ZORderStage, TorusZOrderStage...
        Layout made from Layer, which has...
            Name
            ClassName of Stage, which can be null and ClassName of a View, which cannot be null.
            Save properties of both - the view has top,left, width, height properties
            BackgroundViews will have additional properties
            If the View has a "stage" property, then Stage cannot be null.

    SceneDesigner shows dotted blue outline for the currently selected layer's position.
    and dotted red outline for the size of the screen.

    When composing a scene from multiple Layouts, then how is the Z-order of the layers specified?
    Either the layers have a Z-order themselves, or the sceneDirector uses : loadScence(string name,boolean above)

Animations to apply start/end events, so that sounds can be played.
	Can also be used to assign a new Pose during a non-framed based animation.


Have a preview image of the animation in FramedAnimationEditor.
	Single step back/forward or continuous.
	In fact, don't have the list or poses, just show one frame's details, and scroll back/forward to edit others.

Redesign editor based on a traditional IDE style layout.
    Left panel contains tree structure of all objects (Poses/Animations/Inputs/Costumes/Scenes etc)
        Can subset the list for a single type (e.g. just Poses)
        Hide those views if there are no children
    Central "Edit" panel will display the currently selected object (pose/animation etc).
    Can be editing multiple items simultaneously, each with its own tab.
        This will have impact on renamed poses etc. Maybe very tricky!
        Maybe abandon Ok/Cancel, and always auto-update.
        Notepad will need "<" and ">" navigation items, when tabs cannot all fit.
    Left panel can also have a "favourites" view and a "Recent" view.
    Toolbar items for Add Pose/Sprite Sheet/Animation/Sound/Input etc.
    SceneDesigner to co-exist, just like any SubEditor.
        The actors in a scene are also listed in the main tree view.
            Shortcut for toolbox pages automatically shows the toolbox.
        Toolbox not free floating
            Either hidden (when not in scene designer), or taking up full width at bottom of screen.
    Toolbox and Side Panel can be hidden/shown via a toggle button in the toolbar (and shortcut).
        Toolbar is always visible
        Toolbar changes depending on what is being edited.
    Still have the Tables (when a category is selected)?


Nice-to-have Features
=====================

Use Scroll for TextArea, instead of its buggy, self implemented, non-clipping scroller.
    Clip the TextBox input too.

Be able to select text in EntryBoxes, and copy/cut/delete the selected text.
    Double click to select a word.

Spritesheet : Crop. Remove all transparent edges, updating the x,y offsets appropriately.
    Use this on the mings spritesheet.

ColorKeyFragment. Use another pose, to decide which pixels belong to each fragment.
    If the poses aren't the same size, then scale non blended.


Code Tidy Up
============

MouseListenerView - Why is Game passed to its methods?

Look at ScriptManager's createXXX methods, and see where they are called from.
    Consider removing createXXX methods, and doing it via ClassName.createInstance instead.

Consider merging Pose & PoseResource. Ditto for other resources.

Should Layout be a NamedResource?
    If not, why are the other resources?
    
Pixelator has a bodge in it. Sometime it needs to add one to all the pixels.
	Do a test, and see if the top row of pixels are blank for large scales, and if so,
		then move blit to another surface before embossing the edges.
	Rename it EmbossEdgesPixelator? Create EmbossPixelator, which embosses every pixel.

WTF is Animation.startExceptFirst ? Parallel certainly doesn't do anything sensible!
	Used when merging two animations. Do it better!!!

Move GraphicsContext to the gui package? Is it used elsewhere (for stages?)

Pyrox : gridRole.onBirth looks like rubbish. Is it called?
Pyrox : gridRole.talk looks weird.

Look at companion, it has font, font size and color. Why ????
    Check sub classes for get/set for font colour size etc. I think this is done now???
    Check sub classes for margins???

Talk and TalkProjectile
    Talk doesn't have "fade", which is the only reason that Gate uses TalkProjectile (it doesn't move!!!)
    Should talk use animations to fade and die or a constant, hard-wired fade?
    Do we need Talk.stop now that we have TalkProjectile? It was originally there, so that it wouldn't follow!

    Zoom in/out : Scale all GridRole objects. Care needed if/when creating new objects.

Should TextPose have a TextStyle, rather than individual attributes?

Why have a Role interface if everything will end up using AbstractRole?
    Why does Role have "birth" and yet everything uses onBirth() ? Ditto with other events.
    At least make Role have the methods that people will actually use ie. onBirth rather than birth.

Disallow roles being removed and added to an actor. An actor has a role for life.
    If you need to change behaviour, do it like the Mings do it, and have a separate class hierarchy. 
    Hmm, Pause does exactly that!
        Probably a bad design, as the user's roles may do some of their own stuff in onActive, and
        not expect it to be called when unpaused.
    Delayed Activation also works like this!

Rox Ideas
=========
    Have a music layer, which has notes at each point. When an object moves over it, call that note's event to play the note.
        When a player stays one square, continue to play the square's note(s)
            The player has events, and the squares have event names. Use animations to control the sequence of notes played?
                Use the player's animations, but animate the Note object so that it doesn't interfere with the player's normal animation.
        Can have a high tempo piece whenever you hover on a "dangerous" or important square.
        Different characters will play different samples (but of the same basic note).
        The "correct" way through the puzzle should always sound harmonious
        Have set riffs, which can be played in different keys.
            While moving across a same-key field, it will sound like "Bah-Bah-Bah-Bah" for each square walked.
            Then when you stand still, the riff continues "Bah-da-da-da-Bah-da-da".
        Some square are silent.
        The square knows the name of the note, but the level know the instrument to use. The sample to use if "$instrument-$note".
        Some music squares can change the instrument too. From and To at choke points
        Use the editor's strings to define the riffs??
        Would be nice to have a visual representation of the music squares values.
            Use Makeup to achieve this?
            Can use colour to denote the note - hue for A-G and saturation/brightness for the octave. Background pattern for the instrument.
        Put the music in the grid at the same time as the GridRoles.
        Use classic songs for some obvious-ish pathways.


Other Stuff
===========

SDL Drop event to add poses by dragging image files.

SceneDesigner for Text
    Don't have a "Text" tool??
    The thumbnail should have the font-size in the bottom right if its bigger than the thumbnail can display.
        Using an Editor's font, because we want a plain, consistent font.
    When saving an actor, only save the attributes which differ from the costume's style.
    Have a "Reset to Costume Defaults", and a "Apply to Costume" buttons.

Group Costumes on the SceneDesigner's toolbox, so that similar costumes can be displayed as a single item.
    Clicking it reveals a popup, where the actual Costume can be selected.
    Use this for Pyrox's machines, one way streets, and maybe even the walls.
        A costume can have a "Group Leader" field, which is the name of the Costume that is displayed as the
        main icon in the scene design toolbox. Similar impl as "costume base"

SceneDesigner : select groups of actors, and move/delete them together.

Create a Background interface :
    NoBackground, RGBABackground
    Tile, BrickH, BrickV, TileH, TileV (spacing can be different to the image size)
    We already have Renderable, which can do nine-patches and flat colour.
    Should the background be scrollable?

Explosion and Projectile don't work very well with text - See Gate.collected.

Should Costumes have Makeup? If each jewel is given a Sparkle makeup, does it make sense to apply it to every jewel in the scene?
    No. A diamond costume would specify a standard makeup, which can be overridden if needed.
    Have a reset button to revert to the costume's makeup, or default makeup if it has none.
    Costumes' makeup just like animations - based on events, and can have multiple options picked a random.
	One Makeup shared by many costumes, so it has its own tab, just like animation. 

GUIView.keyUp does nothing - is this ok?

Later
=====

Use JBox2D : http://www.jbox2d.org/

Joystick input devices.

BlitModes on Pose, so a "spotlight" can ADD

"Duplicate" button in Animation editor - maybe on Costume too.

Drag and drop to move and reorder animation in the editor.
    Replace the whole AnimationEditor with a timeline, where sequence are arranged left to right and parallel are stacked top to bottom.
    Test and edit are done in the same full screen editor - like scene designer.
    Add: Pick a pose, then place it on the world.
    A large time-line pane shows an overview of the animation. Dragging controls will change the tick or loops of the animation.
        Can fill the whole page, with the animation on top of it.
    Click at a point in the time-line to show that frame.
    Save the pose and start x,y, direction, heading with each animation ("test" tag)


Much Later
==========

Simple convolution filter
    Filters don't need to be square.
    Create empty space around the image. Later give option of duping the image's edge.
    Apply the convolution matrix.
        For RGB, just apply the matrix to each channel in turn.
        For RGBA we'd need to change the final DIVIDE to discount transparent pixels. i.e divide by sum of matrix * alphas.
        Apply the matrix to alpha as normal.

   Many things just need the alpha channel convolved?

Look at rotozoom, and try to implement a generic affine transformation matrix???
    Calc size of dest
    Calc pos of corners
    Bresinem walk from translated top left to bottom left.
        Bres walk across the "row"
        Copy pixel.
    That only leaves the problem of blending.
        Instead of choosing one src pixel, we consider the rectangle from the source
            Where the rect is large, average multiple pixels
            Where the rect is small (less than 2x2 pixels), average parts of each pixel.

Same pattern for sounds and animations, not for font or nine patches.


How about a Scripts tab
    List all scripts double click to edit.
    Show errors / Clear errors

Get Thrust to run via "launch" without the resource symlinks to itchy.
    Need thrust's jar file to be in a lib directory within its resources, and for the jar to be loaded
    after java has started.

iThrust
	Bucket to be more transparent
	Water looks naff

Component : Override all rules. Currently only Font can be overridden.
    Allow to be reset to default (i.e. be restyled).

Create a game which uses the GUI

Replace crufty render and render2 methods with the concept of a Graphics Context.
To scroll, a sub-layer, push the context, alter its mapping, call the childrens render,
then pop the context.
