Current Tasks
=============

Make some gates need balloons 2, rocks 2, instead of 3, 3?
    Or make a new balloons3?

Look over all TODOs


Destroy-Debris
    Do the offsets for all rocks (most are done).
    Adjust the speed and rotation for both ships to make good game play.
 

BUGS
====

Cannot start a new animation from a finish event of an old animation (Dodge 'Em Player wanted to do it)

Explosion has to manually tick the animation in order for the first frame to be displayed correctly.
Shouldn't the act of SETTING an animation cause the first tick to take place?
