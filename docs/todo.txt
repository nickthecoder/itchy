Javadoc & code review...

Actor
    Delete adjustHeading?
    Actor.getCornerX,Y Hardly used. Delete?
    Actor.removeFromStage Not used?
    Make Actor class final (and remove final from method sigs).
    Actor isActive - what is this? Document it or remove.
    Does isDying still return true after an actor dies?
    Remove Actor.getSurface
    Actor.moveTo(Actor) Needed?
    Actor.moveForwards(forwards,sideways) sideways is to the left? A little non-mathematical.
        Create a unit test for this.
    Ac≈•or.moveAngle - not needed?
    Actor.moveToward - not needed?
    Actor.contains - needed?
    Actor.nearest - needed? If so why return a Role from Actor class?
    Actor.adjustZOrder needed?
    
    Create a ActorMath class, which has static methods like distance(Actor a, Actor b)
        distanceTo, directionOf, moveAngle, moveTowards

Layout, Layer
    Layer has public name, and public get/setName.
    
    
Game
    getFrameRate - Not used. There is no corresponding setter, and just ask for Itchy's frameRate. Remove? 
    stages, getStages are these used? Should do everything via Layout and Layers.
    layout and getLayout are both public.
    Should Director.loadScene exist?
    Does Editor need to be a subclass of Game? Eeek! Can't Editor be a Director, which is more in keeping with the Itchy philosophy.
        Game could then be a final class.
    Rename findRoleByTag to findRolesByTag

Itchy
    Why have loadGame and currentGame?
    Replace baseDirectory with ItchyResourcesPath, which defaults to "./resources", but can be a set of directories.
    Numerous things, if changed, can affect other games. Shouldn't they be on Game instead? e.g. keyboard repeat, FrameRate.

View
    getRelativeRect - is this used/needed?
    isVisible - is this used/needed?
    
StageView
    Why does enableMouseListener take a Game parameter?
    
Costume
    createActor Needed ?
    
ZOrderStage
    Look at ZOrderStageInterface. Is it needed, and if so, is it used in the correct places instead of ZOrderStage.
        We don't move up/down the z-order any more.

Appearance
    is adjustAlpha needed?
    superimpose - need to reset scale, direction, colorize ??? Use fixAppearance first.

CostumeFeatures
    Does it NEED to have a costume attribute? Most times it won't be used. Leave as an option for the sub-class.
        In fact, make CostumeFeatures an empty interface.

ImagePose
    load- not used.
 
AbstractRole    
    detached removes all tags, so how do collisions work after Pause???
        If we allow Roles to keep their tags when detached,
            then tags must use weak references, otherwise they will not be gc'd.
            Collision Strategies must take care to check for detached Roles
            Should probably set Role's actor to null
             


Priority Doc
    Turn the generalise arrows the right way.





     
Make some gates need balloons 2, rocks 2, instead of 3, 3?
    Or make a new balloons3?

Look over all TODOs


Destroy-Debris
    Do the offsets for all rocks (most are done).
    Adjust the speed and rotation for both ships to make good game play.
 

BUGS
====

Destroy-Debris
    Next level "hyperspace" is not displayed at all.
 
Cannot start a new animation from a finish event of an old animation (Dodge 'Em Player wanted to do it)
