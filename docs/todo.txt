Jame is out of date, need to rebuild for win32 and i386 and ARM??
    Compile and test using windows.
    Add the dependant dlls to jame's git tree?
        No. If NuGet can automate the download of dependencies, then an ant task can bundle them.
    Add the compiled dll and .so files to jame's git tree??
        No. Ant task which uploads the compiled object to a ftp server?

What's Next
===========

Finish Costume properties
    Place Events and Properties into a Notebook.
    Have an instance of the class

Component : Override all rules. Currently only Font can be overridden.  
    Allow to be reset to default (i.e. be restyled). 

Bucket to be more transparent
Water looks naff
No instructions for picking up water

Move appearance properties to their own tab, rather than on Actor tab.

Implement Costume custom properties
    GUI
    Load/Save
    Refactor the code which uses Costume's strings. Replace with custom properties.
    Should it get the list of properties from the Behaviour?
        Behaviour's properties have a scope of either Costume or Behaviour?
    Or should a costume have a "CostumeProperty" class 

Javacript for each Behaviour, SceneBehaviour and later for Game itself.
    If the Behaviour is JavascriptBehaviour, then look for a text file with the appropriate name relative to
    the resources file.


    

Bugs
====

One of the animation profiles shows that the NumericAnimation isn't quite right.

When a window has no focusable components, then it recurses till the stack explodes.

Designer can scale actors to -ve values, which are then unselectable

Popup windows dont center themselves when window grows. Should they?

Check what happens when you load and save and reload a single non-compound animation. Is it right?
   In the editor, the top-most animation must always be a CompoundAnimation

On Remove, there is no check that the resource isn't being used by something else.
    Easy pose, animation, sound..., but tricky for costume, as they could be used in any scene
    
Renaming a costume will cause scenes that use it to fail.

Costumes are updated even when cancel is pressed (need to COPY the costume?)

Later
=====

Icons on each editor tab and also on the CostumeEditor for each event type (String,Pose,Sound etc).

Create a GenericGame, which can load arbitrary resources (for a simple start to a game)
    Started (called Launcher).

Create a game which uses the GUI        
    The Rules object needs to be on Game, its probably on Itchy right now.

Try it on a RaspPi
    Need to compile Jame for the ARM processor!

The Behaviours should have the tags, because its them that have the Interface.
Also, I could change the behaviour, and the tags would magically vanish (without the "removeAll"!
Don't use tags for "active".

Container.render should get the NinePatches to render directly onto the gc, not via a temp surface.
RenderableInterface is rubbish. NinePatches should be told where and how large to draw themselves
   (assuming that they can render onto a existing surface rather than needing a new surface).


Replace crufty render and render2 methods with the concept of a Graphics Context.
To scroll, a sub-layer, push the context, alter its mapping, call the childrens render,
then pop the context.

Appearance optimised so that it doesn't need to re-render the appearance to get the worldRectangle
    Maybe calculate the maximum rectangle for the Pose for any rotation
    When asked for its wordRect, if cached, returned that, other wise if direction == 0, return pose.rectangle * scale, otherwise return maximum rect * scale
