Jame is out of date, need to rebuild for win32 and i386 and ARM??
    Compile and test using windows.
    Add the dependant dlls to jame's git tree?
        No. If NuGet can automate the download of dependencies, then an ant task can bundle them.
    Add the compiled dll and .so files to jame's git tree??
        No. Ant task which uploads the compiled object to a ftp server?

What's Next
===========

When getting a property value from a script, if it doesn't return a valid value, report in stderr, and
    return a reasonable default. "", 0, 0.0, black.

Bug : It seems that the editor is using the REAL behaviour for some text buttons (easy,medium,hard),
    when it should be using a SceneBehvaiour???
    Is this also what's causing ./launch tetra --editor spewing out lots of stack traces?

CostumeProperties
    Use auto update components, so we don't have the fragile "for" loop in onOk.
    Create the object when the name is set, then in onOk, set the className (which 
        will create another version), and then copy the attributes over.
    
Fix frame rate problems at the start of the game.

"include" javascript function, which includes another script file.

Check that Add Scene doesn't rename.

Check that a broken script doesn't cause problems :
    Costume Properties
    Behaviour in editor
    Behaviour in designer
    SceneBehaviour in editor
    SceneBehaviour in designer
    Game


Create a "Game" which lists all of the games, and clicking one will play it
    List all directories in the "resources" directory containing a like named xml file. 
    Exclude itself
    A vertical scroll c a set of buttons.

Rain : reset high scores

Game.getPreferences to use a better key than the current game's class name, as they could easily be Game
    or ScriptedGame.
    Instead use the name of the resources directory, prefixed with uk.co.nickthecoder.itchy.
    A subclass of Game can override this.

Bugs
====

One of the animation profiles shows that the NumericAnimation isn't quite right.

When a window has no focusable components, then it recurses till the stack explodes.

Popup windows dont center themselves when window grows. Should they?

On Remove, there is no check that the resource isn't being used by something else.
    Easy pose, animation, sound..., but tricky for costume, as they could be used in any scene
    
Renaming a costume will cause scenes that use it to fail.

Costumes are updated even when cancel is pressed (need to COPY the costume?)

Later
=====


Bucket to be more transparent
Water looks naff

The stars on Drunk Invaders backgrounds should have more variation (alpha and slight colour - maybe size too).

Component : Override all rules. Currently only Font can be overridden.  
    Allow to be reset to default (i.e. be restyled). 

Icons on each editor tab and also on the CostumeEditor for each event type (String,Pose,Sound etc).

Create a GenericGame, which can load arbitrary resources (for a simple start to a game)
    Started (called Launcher).

Create a game which uses the GUI        
    The Rules object needs to be on Game, its probably on Itchy right now.

Try it on a RaspPi
    Need to compile Jame for the ARM processor!

The Behaviours should have the tags, because its them that have the Interface.
Also, I could change the behaviour, and the tags would magically vanish (without the "removeAll"!
Don't use tags for "active".

Container.render should get the NinePatches to render directly onto the gc, not via a temp surface.
RenderableInterface is rubbish. NinePatches should be told where and how large to draw themselves
   (assuming that they can render onto a existing surface rather than needing a new surface).


Replace crufty render and render2 methods with the concept of a Graphics Context.
To scroll, a sub-layer, push the context, alter its mapping, call the childrens render,
then pop the context.

Appearance optimised so that it doesn't need to re-render the appearance to get the worldRectangle
    Maybe calculate the maximum rectangle for the Pose for any rotation
    When asked for its worldRect, if cached, returned that, other wise if direction == 0, return pose.rectangle * scale, otherwise return maximum rect * scale
