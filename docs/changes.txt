2013-07-03
==========
Added a shield to DrunkInvader's ship.
New FrameRate class to keep a consistent frame rate, inspired by Simon Lucas.

Milestone
=========
Its exactly one year since I started writing Itchy (only about 2 months actually writing it - a 10 month gap).
I'm very happy with progress. Writing games in Itchy is very nice. It easy to get something smart
up and running very quickly.
The editor needs a LOT of polish.

2013-07-02
==========
Used eclipse's Clean Up to tidy up all of the code.
Refactored Property, so that sub classes of Behaviour don't need to use generics. 
Actors in a scene can delay being activated. Used this for the mothership.
Drunkinvaders: scaled up aliens bounce with appropriate amount of mass.

2013-07-01
==========
Added "GameLoopJob" which allows game to sleep, without the nastiness of multi-threading.
Refactored AlienFactory to use sleep.
Added 'random' utilities onceEvery and oneIn.
Normalised the time units used in DrunkInvaders to seconds

2013-06-30
==========
Added MothershipBehaviour to drunkinvaders
Added new type of animation : ScaleAnimation 
Ship reload is better (reloads as soon as the previous bullet dies).

2013-06-29
==========
OMG, I assumed the game was syncing its frame rate with the monitor frame rate.
It wasn't, instead, it was going as fast as the CPU could manage, which is what made it
appear as though my laptop wasn't fast enough to run the game. (It was running at 250 fps).
Added a simplistic delay to the game loop so each frame is takes a consistant amount of time,
and adjusted all of the drunkinvaders timings to take reflect the new frame rate. 


2012-08-14
==========
Changed all float attributes to doubles.
Refactored the guis listeners
Added Text tool to the editor, save and load. (can't change the text yet)
Added properties to the designer (x,y,alpha,direction,scale, fontsize, text )

2012-08-10 ish
==========

Started on the scene designer. Can place actors into the scene, move, scale and rotate them.
Can change the z-order of actors.
Can pan the viewport.
Can save the scene.
(Can't set Actor's attributes yet)

2012-08-04
==========
Table sorting

2012-08-01 .. 03
==========
Completed all editor pages, apart from Costume's edit details.
Fixed bugs in VerticalScroll
Added "image" to Rule, so that checkboxes can have their tick/cross styled by Rules.

2012-07-31
==========
Continued work on AnimationEditor, including FramedAnimationEditor
Created a CheckBox component, as it was needed for pingPong boolean.
Created a PickerButton, and a HashMapPicker, which together work similarly to a "combobox".

2012-07-30
==========
Began work on the AnimationEditor

2012-07-29
==========

Added the NinePatch page to the editor
Added concept of thumbnail to PoseResource and NinePatch resource, and used them on tables.

2012-07-28
==========

Added a draggable scroll bar.
Added a file open dialog, and used it when adding sounds.
Added the Fonts page, without add or remove yet
Created a FileComponent, which combines a text box, a prompt button to search for a file, and a rename button.

2012-07-27
==========

Changed the way components are rendered, creating GraphicsContext.

2012-07-26
==========

Created ResourceWriter, which needed changes to Resources and Costume.

2012-07-25
==========

Completed TextBox
First cut of VerticalScroll - no scrollbar or keyboard scrolling (only scrollwheel).
Sounds and Poses Tab functional except for "Add" and "Remove"
Added "focus", tab works, shift-tab doesn't

2012-07-20 .. 2012-07-24
==========

Began the gui package, which will be a GUI toolkit using SDL
Small test rig for gui components
HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout
Label, Button
Notebook
Table and its associated classes
Rule and Rules implement a style sheet, and RuleLoader can load in from an XML file.
FlowLayout

Began the Editor (which is the main reason for needing a GUI toolkit).

2012-07-19
==========

Added Eight/Nine patch, which allows the alien's speech to appear in speech bubbles.
Includes support in Resources and ResourceReader
Jame's build.xml now includes the native stuff too (ant calls make, so Makefile is still used).
Incorporated the software blitters from pygame
Used pygame's blitters to get the gui off the ground. Got a horizontal layout of one label working.  

2012-07-18
==========

All of the JNI methods are in place for itchy, and itchy was ported to the new Jame SDL wrapper.


2012-07-17
==========

Made good headway on my JNI SDL wrapper (which I've called Jame). Nearly all of the required
Video calls have been implemented.

2012-07-16
==========

Continued the GUI package, but ran into a roadblock when I found that SDL can't composite one
RGBA surface over another. While looking through the sdljava code, I found some real nasty
gotchas waiting for me when I came to make itchy multi-threaded... The JNI C code states that
blitting isn't allowed to be multithreaded (even if operating on disparate surfaces), because
the JNI C code reuses a static SDL_Rect object. What a pile of crap sdljava is!!!
So I've decided to create my own JNI wrapper for the parts of SDL that I need.

2012-07-14
==========

Added greater flexibility to Animation. Can now have sequential and parallel animations
Created an "Eased" animation, where an attribute can be altered at various rates (default is to change linearly).
Added Animations : alpha, turn, move
Added window title and wrote code for the window icon, but it didn't work. I think its not my code at fault :-(

2012-07-13
==========

Added sound.
Can load resources from an xml definition file.
Implemented "Costume" - an Actor has a Costume, which holds a HashMap of the poses he can display.
  This allows one Behaviour class to appear differently - Each line of aliens has their own costume, and therefore look different.
Extended Costume to hold Sounds, Strings and Fonts.
  This allows the aliens to have different death screams, and to "say" different things.
Added Animations, and used it to animate the alien bombs

2012-07-12
==========

Added pixel collision detection between actors.
A "Neighbourhood" system to change collision detection from Order(N * N) to Order( N ) was started, but not finished.
The game doesn't have performance problems on my PC!
Created a couple of helper classes to make special effects easy ( ExplosionBehaviour and ProjectileBehaviour ).
Began putting polish on the example game (called Drunk Invaders).
Can display text for an Actor's appearance (TextPose class).

2012-07-11
==========

The itchy framework is taking shape, and I have a rudimentary game running.
So far, there are Layers which can hold Actors. Actors have a Behaviour who's tick method is called once per frame.
A simple event handler is in place, including a "keyboard" state, which is basically an array of the up/down state of all of the keys. 

2012-07-03
==========

Started Itchy after being inspired by Simon's success with SDL with the sdljava Java bindings.
Itchy is the sequel to Itch (which was a newbie friendly game engine written in Python). After many failed attempts
refactoring python code, I've all but given up on the language for projects of any reasonable size.
I find coding in Java is MUCH quicker than python. Errors are spotted while you type. There are many
refactorings which can be done automatically by the eclipse IDE. Even if you aren't using an IDE, catching
errors at compile time is much better than finding them at run time, as is the case with Python.
