Work in Progress
================

Smasher to remove solid objects

Bugs
====

Shear walls cause the mings to step up before turning around

Selection is too eager - use contains, rather than distance.

Blocker shouldn't block on pixels alone, also needs to know the direction of movement

Can see the head of the ming as they enter the scene

New Features
============

StageView to have addMouseListener, so that mouse events can easily be handled by a game's script
Only fires when the mouse is in the view, and the coordinates are adjusted appropriately.
Should this fire before/after those for the actor's? (An option when enabled).
