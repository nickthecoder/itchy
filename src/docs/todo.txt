Javadoc & code review...

Point to be interface, including lots of setter methods, 
    Concrete classes UnmodifiablePoint and ModifiablePoint (which has an protected update method, which does nothing)
    ActorPoint extends ModifiablePoint and uses the update to 
OR, Point is a base class, with an empty update method, and ActorPoint extends it.
   

Game
    Does Editor need to be a subclass of Game?
        Can't Editor be a Director, which is more in keeping with the Itchy philosophy.
        Game could then be a final class.

Itchy
    Numerous things, if changed, can affect other games. Shouldn't they be on Game instead? e.g. keyboard repeat

View
    getRelativeRect - is this used/needed?
    isVisible - is this used/needed?
    
StageView
    Why does enableMouseListener take a Game parameter? Maybe ok.

Appearance
    superimpose - need to reset scale, direction, colorize ??? Use fixAppearance first.


     
Make some gates need balloons 2, rocks 2, instead of 3, 3?
    Or make a new balloons3?

Look over all TODOs


Destroy-Debris
    Do the offsets for all rocks (most are done).
    Adjust the speed and rotation for both ships to make good game play.
 
 
Client/Server needs to use UDP:
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/datagrams/clientServer.html 

Replace Itchy's baseDirectory with ItchyResourcesPath, which defaults to "./resources", but can be a set of directories.

BUGS
====

l & k dodge scenes are duplicates

Close button in editor does nothing.

The-Mings
    Basher and digger no longer remove anything.

Destroy-Debris
    Next level "hyperspace" effect is not displayed at all.
 
Cannot start a new animation from a finish event of an old animation (Dodge 'Em Player wanted to do it)

Cavern Quest
    Sometimes you do not die when caught by a nasty.
    
Test
    Projectiles, Forwards, Sidewards, Rotate, Speed don't do what I expect.
