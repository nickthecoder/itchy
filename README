If you want to write games, then Itchy takes care of the hard stuff, while you take care of the fun, creative stuff!

Itchy is an easy to use 2D Java game engine. Its aim is to be easy enough to encourage children to
start writing real programs, graduating from the excellent, but limiting programming environments such as Scratch.

It is designed to be fast, using SDL as its low level graphics API, via a java wrapper called "Jame".

To run the example games :

./launch
